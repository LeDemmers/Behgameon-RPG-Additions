# Behgameon-RPG-Additions
Behgameon is a collaborative project that adds 100+ new bauble (1.12.2)/ curios (1.14.4) items that are static. Meaning they do nothing! However, if you have something along the lines of Mine and Slash they will automatically link into that system and gain stats. This project was started in the hopes of not finding the same looking accessories while adventuring in Mine and Slash. However, say you want an rpg server that has its own baubles that do their own thing? Install this ole thing, and give say the necklace +3 Health, and equip it like that.
